Orio Email Automation Notes
4.25.2017

1) Download PDF of latest Sales Update from Rick, saving it in Rewards and Shipments folder
2) Export PDF to Excel Worksheet (.xlsx)
3) Run Python script that will save the pertinent data into a dictionary with the OSC Code as the key
4) Open the "Mail Merge [date]" Excel file
5) Copy all the dictionary values into the corresponding columns in the worksheet, using the correct format
6) Using either the "Contacts" sheet in the Mail Merge file or a contact spreadsheet somehow uploaded to the Python program,
	store the OSC's contact data in a dictionary with the OSC code as key again
7) Going through each OSC, copy over General Manager, Service Manager, and Parts Manager emails, but only if they're valid and not duplicates.
	If there's only one email for the entire OSC (if this is the protocol we should follow) at least copy that email over
8) This "Mail Merge" sheet should now have OSC code, name, reward, goal, Aero level, purchases to date, % of goal, purchases to go listed with the
	name and email of each existing, pertinent contact at the OSC.
